# Extreme-Learning-Machines
Python implementation for Seeded KMeans in ELM feature space

clustering the labeled and unlabeled data sets using Semi Supervised 
K-Means algorithm which will be used to cluster the documents extracted 
from the ELM (Extreme Learning Machine) feature space. 
The clusters will then be labeled using cluster assumption.
